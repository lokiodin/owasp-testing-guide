# Fuzz Vectors

The following are fuzzing vectors which can be used with [ZAP](https://www.zaproxy.org), [Burp Suite](https://portswigger.net/burp), or another testing tool. [Fuzzing](https://owasp.org/www-community/Fuzzing) is the "kitchen sink" approach to testing the responses of an application to parameter manipulation. Generally, an analyst looks for error conditions or abnormal behaviors that occur in an application as a result of fuzzing.

The following references are provided as input sources for fuzzing and related testing activities.
